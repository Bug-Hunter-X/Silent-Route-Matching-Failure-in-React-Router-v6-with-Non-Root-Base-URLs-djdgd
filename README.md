# Silent Route Matching Failure in React Router v6 with Non-Root Base URLs

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 where routes fail to match correctly when a non-root base URL is used without explicit configuration.  The issue is that if your application is deployed under a path other than the root (e.g., `/my-app`), the default behavior of `BrowserRouter` might not handle this properly resulting in broken navigation. 

## Bug Description

The provided `App.js` file shows a simple React Router v6 setup. If this application is deployed under a path like `/my-app`, links to `/about` or `/contact` will appear to work but will not actually navigate.  The application will not throw an error; it will simply remain on the current page.

## Solution

The solution in `AppSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly configure the `BrowserRouter` to handle non-root base URLs using the `basename` prop. This ensures that the routes match as expected regardless of the deployment path.
